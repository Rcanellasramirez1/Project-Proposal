<h1>OIM3690 Web Technologies - Term Project Proposal - Roberto Canellas</h1>
<img src="images/puertorico.jpg" alt="Puerto Rico">
    <ul>
    <li><h2>What is your website about?</h2></li>
    </ul>
        <p>I will make my website about Puerto Rico where it will explain Puerto Rico’s current situation and entice people to visit the island. </p>
        <ul>
        <li><h2>What is the objective of your website? (Also read as why would this site be important?)</h2></li>
        </ul>
        <p>The objective of the website is to bring to light Puerto Rico’s current situation to eliminate the stigma that surrounds the island, which many say the island has not recovered from the hurricane and that it is dangerous. Then attracting the viewers with great imagery and descriptions of the landscapes, locations and beaches that can be visited in the island. Making this website important as it will attract people to visit our great island which is in need of tourists to maintain the tourism industry which was horribly impacted by Covid-19.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><h2>Who is your target audience?</h2></li>
        </ul>
        <p>My target audience are young adults and families who are looking for an adventure as Puerto Rico has many beautiful experiences to offer but since media has portrayed us as an island plagued with crime and that was destroyed by hurricane Maria never being able to recover. This two target audiences are the same audience that media tends to target meaning that this website will be a tool to fight that stigma created by the media.</p>
        <ul>
        <li><h2>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h2></li>
        </ul>
        <p>I plan to include imagery, anecdotes, and descriptions that show the true Puerto Rico, not the one that media tends to talk about all the time. I would make the first page a welcome with images and a bit of history of the island. The second page would be one explaining the current situation of the island. The third would be to talk about the capital and what it has to offer. The fourth would be to talk about the north and west areas have to offer. Finally the fifth page would be what the south and east have to offer. Making this website a very whole one giving visitors insights on all the regions of Puerto Rico.</p>
